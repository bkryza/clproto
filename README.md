Protocol
========

*Protocol* is a part of *onedata* system that unifies access to files stored at heterogeneous data storage systems 
that belong to geographically distributed organizations.

Goals
-----

The goal of *protocol* is provision of a protocol between *oneprovider* (self-scalable cluster that will is a central 
point of each data centre that uses *onedata*) and *oneclient* (a user space file system that that frees users from 
problems related to data access in heterogeneous environments).

Getting Started
---------------

*Protocol* is NOT a standalone project. It shouldn't be built separately. It should be build only with 
*oneprovider* or *oneclient*.
